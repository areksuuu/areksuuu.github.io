<h2>The Beatles - Hey Judes</h2>
<pre>Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
And anytime you feel the pain
Hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her (let it out and let it in)

So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you

<h2>Slipknot - The Heretic Anthem</h2>
<pre>I'm a popstar threat and I'm not dead yet
Got a super dred bet with an angel drug head
Like a dead beat winner, I want to be a sinner
An idolized bang for the industry killer
A hideous man that you don't understand
Throw a suicide party and I'm guaranteed to fucking snap
I'm supersonic, its pornoholic
Breakdowns, obscenities its all I want to be
If you're 555, then I'm 666
If your 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, then I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
If your 555, I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
Everybody's so infatuated
Everybody's so completely sure of what we are
Everybody defamates from miles away
But face to face they haven't got a thing to say
I bleed for this and I bleed for you
Still you look at my face like I'm somebody new
Toy nobody wants anything I've got
Which is fine because your made of
Everything-I'm-not
If you're 555, then I'm 666
If your 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, then I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
If your 555, I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
Thirty seconds, sixteen, eight, four, lemme tell you why
I haven't the slightest, I'm teaching your brightest
They're listening, clamoring
All the money in the world can't buy me
Go ahead, lie to me
Tell me again how you're tortured
I want to know how you fallowed your orders so well
Your full of shit
You had a dream, but this ain't it
If you're 555, then I'm 666
If your 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, then I'm 666
If your 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, then I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
If your 555, I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
If you're 555, then I'm 666
(Whats it like to be a heretic?)
If your 555, I'm 666
